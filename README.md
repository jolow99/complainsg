# ComplainSG

A conversational assistant for collecting, clarifying, and summarizing citizen complaints, powered by LLMs and [pocketflow](https://github.com/jolow/pocketflow).

## Features

- **Interactive Complaint Intake:** Guides users to describe their complaint.
- **Automated Clarification:** Uses an LLM to suggest follow-up questions for missing details.
- **Iterative Q&A:** Collects answers and continues until enough information is gathered.
- **Summary Generation:** Produces a clear, single-paragraph summary for processing.

## How It Works

1. **User describes a complaint.**
2. **The assistant asks clarifying questions** (generated by an LLM).
3. **User answers each question** until the assistant determines the complaint is “complete.”
4. **A summary is generated** for the final submission.

## Setup (CLI)

1. **Clone the repository** and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
   ```
   Or, if you use `pip`:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up API key:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     QWEN3_FREE=your_api_key_here
     ```
   - Or set the environment variable directly.

3. **Run the app:**
   ```sh
   uv run main.py
   ```
   Or:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

   for streaming use

   ```sh
   python main.py --stream
   ```

## Setup (Frontend)

cd frontend
npm run build

## Run FastAPI server with frontend

fastapi dev server.py

## Requirements

## Project Structure

- `main.py` — Entry point; runs the complaint flow.
- `flow.py` — Defines the flow of nodes (steps).
- `nodes.py` — Logic for each step: intake, follow-up, decision, summary.
- `utils.py` — LLM call utility.
- `pyproject.toml` — Dependencies.
